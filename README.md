# Dockerising a Flask micro-framework API

## The Flask API

In this project, I set out to create a web API that will create, update, delete and edit bucketlists.
The API is deveoped in flask with help from FlaskRestful.

## API Functionality Scope

For installation steps, go to https://github.com/davidmukiibi/CP2A-BucketList-Application-API for detailed steps on how to achieve that as this will only cater for dockerizing that same app. 

## Installation and Setup.

Assuming you have docker and docker compose are installed already locally. But if you do not,
follow the steps on this site https://www.docker.com/get-docker for docker, and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for docker compose.

With that set up, clone this repo so that we get started.
